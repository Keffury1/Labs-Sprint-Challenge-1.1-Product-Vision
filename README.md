### Prompt 1

Describe the conversations you had this sprint with your product owner(s) and team.

- Describe the product and features you plan to deliver.

// My team is building on top of a pre-established project that is designed to put mobile car washers in touch with those who need a car wash, but do not have the time. We will allow washers to set their price and notify the carâ€™s owner when the job is complete. We are making amendments from the original backend to better suit our iOS app that will be completely new to the project.

- How did these conversations determine the features you will deliver during Labs?

// The conversations ensured us that our ideas are on point with what the owner and team wants. We now feel more confident than ever that our project has the potential to be something great.

- How did your discussions change the way you viewed the product?

// I previously believed that our group might struggle with the obstacles we have in our way, but I was surprised and had my mind changed to that fact when we rallied together and put together the presentation that allowed us to be in such a spot as we are.


### Prompt 2

Describe the technical or design discussions that shaped the long-term product vision.

- **For data scientists and engineers:** Describe the technologies that you will use to build this product. Why do they fit the product vision?

// The technologies we have chosen to use on the backend of this project is exclusively firebase. It fits our vision in that it is the easiest and most effective backend we could find. The two iOS developers, myself included, believe that Firebase will be easiest due to their extensive work with it during their curriculum. I will also be using Xcode and possibly other frameworks we may see fit to use. No other at this point. As for Xcode, it is necessary in order to make the project.


- **For UX designers:** Describe the questions that you are asking during user research. Why have you selected these questions to ask? What is the problem your team is trying to solve?

You are expected to be able to answer all these questions. Your responses contribute to your Journal Entry grade. Skipping this section _will_ prevent you from passing this challenge.
